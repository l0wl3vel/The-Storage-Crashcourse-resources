[![Cloud Native Rejekts 2023 Youtube Video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/bXnhTLLoHBs/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/bXnhTLLoHBs)

## Abstract

Storage, Persistence and Databases are important parts of most Kubernetes operations. It is a broad topic which this talk tries to demystify. We will go over how Kubernetes storage works, how CSI fits into it, which storage provider options are out there, and how to select the right one for your environment.

Another topic I will talk about is backups and disaster recovery, which will be covered by explaining how CSI Snapshots work and how to make your backups ransomware-proof.

There are also Storage patterns that do not use normal file systems, like S3-style Object Storage and Databases. I will give you some inspiration how and where to integrate them into your applications with the goal to decrease cost and increase performance.

I am going to share some practical experiences on running SQL Databases in your clusters and how to ensure reliability and ease of use.
